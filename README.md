# LLM-SQL-AGENT

LLM-powered agent for natural language SQL queries. Team research project using LangChain for DATA601, University of Canterbury.

## Project Overview
This project aims to build an advanced AI-powered query system, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interact with SQL databases. The system accepts natural language input, translates it to SQL commands using LangChain, executes the query, and returns results in a human-readable format.

## Objectives
- Familiarize with LangChain and its use in language model applications
- Design and implement a suitable SQL database (ERD, schema, sample data)
- Develop a robust LLM agent to handle query translation and execution
- Build an interactive user interface (e.g., with Streamlit or Flask)
- Deliver clear documentation, project plan, and technical reports
- Showcase project outcomes with demos and weekly updates

## Repository Structure
```
/docs      - Project documentation, plans, weekly updates
/db        - Database schema, ER diagrams, sample data
/agent     - LLM agent code and prompt engineering files
/ui        - Frontend code and interface prototypes
/tests     - Unit and integration tests
README.md  - Project introduction and guide
```

## Team & Roles
We work together on all parts of the project, dividing tasks weekly based on interest and learning goals. Roles are flexible and adjusted as needed.

## Progress & Planning
- Initial meeting: project kick-off, supervisor Q&A, schedule setup
- Literature & landscape review: SQL Agents, LangChain, multi-agent architectures
- Technical exploration: example databases, toolkit schema tools, safety features
- Weekly updates and timeline recorded in `/docs/weekly-updates/`
- Next steps: finalize team roles, define tasks for Week 2, set up Project Board

## Getting Started
*To be updated: install instructions, how to run agent code, interface demo*
